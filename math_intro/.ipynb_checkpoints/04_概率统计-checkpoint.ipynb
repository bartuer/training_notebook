    "## Least Squares Regression\n",
    "In the previous examples, we drew a line on a scatter plot to show the *best fit* of the data. In many cases, your initial attempts to identify any colinearity might involve adding this kind of line by hand (or just mentally visualizing it); but as you may suspect from the use of the *numpy.**polyfit*** function in the code above, there are ways to calculate the coordinates for this line mathematically. One of the most commonly used techniques is *least squares regression*, and that's what we'll look at now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cast your mind back to when you were learning how to solve linear equations, and recall that the *slope-intercept* form of a linear equation lookes like this:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}y = mx + b\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, *y* and *x* are the coordinate variables, *m* is the slope of the line, and *b* is the y-intercept of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our scatter plot for our former-student's working hours, we already have our values for *x* (*Grade*) and *y* (*Hours*), so we just need to calculate the intercept and slope of the straight line that lies closest to those points. Then we can form a linear equation that calculates the a new *y* value on that line for each of our *x* (*Grade*) values - to avoid confusion, we'll call this new *y* value *f(x)* (because it's the output from a linear equation function based on *x*). The difference between the original *y* (*Hours*) value and the *f(x)* value is the *error* between our regression line of best fit and the actual *Hours* worked by the former student. Our goal is to calculate the slope and intercept for a line with the lowest overall error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we define the overall error by taking the error for each point, squaring it, and adding all the squared errors together. The line of best fit is the line that gives us the lowest value for the sum of the squared errors - hence the name *least squares regression*.\n",

So the probability of getting *heads* in a single coin toss is 0.5 (or 50% when expressed as a percentage).\n",

    "One particular type of random variable that we use in statistics is a *binomial* variable. A binomial variable is used to count how frequently an event occurs in a fixed number of repeated independent experiments. The event in question must have the same probability of occurring in each experiment, and indicates the success or failure of the experiment; with a probability ***p*** of success, which has a complement of ***1 - p*** as the probability of failure (we often call this kind of experiment a *Bernoulli Trial* after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli).\n",

We know that the mean weight (the *expected value* for the weight of a bag) in our sampling distribution is 3.2, and we assume this is also the population mean for all bags; but how confident can we be that the true mean weight of all carry-on bags is close to the value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start to put some precision onto these terms. We could state the question another way. What's the range of weights within which are confident that the mean weight of a carry-on bag will be 95% of the time? To calculate this, we need to determine the range of values within which the population mean weight is likely to be in 95% of samples. This is known as a *confidence interval*; and it's based on the Z-scores inherent in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are expressed as a sample statistic &plusmn; (*plus or minus*) a margin of error. To calculate the margin of error, you need to determine the confidence level you want to find (for example, 95%), and determine the Z score that marks the threshold above or below which the values that are *not* within the chosen interval reside. For example, to calculate a 95% confidence interval, you need the critical Z scores that exclude 5% of the values under the curve; with 2.5% of them being lower than the values in the confidence interval range, and 2.5% being higher. In a normal distribution, 95% of the area under the curve is between a Z score of &plusmn; 1.96. The following table shows the critical Z values for some other popular confidence interval ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Confidence  | Z Score |\n",
    "|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| 90%         | 1.645   |\n",
    "| 95%         | 1.96    |\n",
    "| 99%         | 2.576   |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval around a sample statistic, we simply calculate the *standard error* for that statistic as described previously, and multiply this by the approriate Z score for the confidence interval we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the 95% confidence interval margin of error for our bag weights, we multiply our standard error of 0.053 by the Z score for a 95% confidence level, which is 1.96:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}MoE = 0.053 \\times 1.96 = 0.10388 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can say that we're confident that the population mean weight is in the range of the sample mean &plusmn; 0.10388 with 95% confidence. Thanks to the central limit theorem, if we used an even bigger sample size, the confidence interval would become smaller as the amount of variance in the distribution is reduced. If the number of samples were infinite, the standard error would be 0 and the confidence interval would become a certain value that reflects the true mean weight for all carry-on bags:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the *scipy.stats.**norm.interval*** function to calculate a confidence interval for a normal distribution. Run the following code to recreate the sampling distribution for bag searches with the same parameters, and display the 95% confidence interval for the mean (again, this may take some time to run):"

Note that if the null hypothesis is true, it's still *possible* to get a sample with a mean ranging from just over -5 to just under 5. The question is how *probable* is it to get a sample with a mean as high we did for our 50-rating sample under the null hypothesis? And how improbable would it *need* to be for us to conclude that the null is, in fact, a poor explanation for our data? \n",

We call the number of standard deviations above the mean where our sample mean is found the *test statistic* (or sometimes just *t-statistic*), and we call the area under the curve from this point (representing the probability of observing a sample mean this high or greater) the *p-value*.\n",

When the standard deviation of the population is not known, the test is referred to as a *t-test* and based on an adjusted version of a normal distribution called a *student's t distribution*, in which the distribution is \"flattened\" to allow for more sample variation depending on the sample size. Generally, with a sample size of 30 or more, a t-test is approximately equivalent to a z-test.\n",

The signal measures the difference between the statistic and the null-hypothesized value, and the noise represents the random variance in the data in the form of standard deviation (or standard error). The t-statistic is the ratio of signal to noise, and measures the number of standard errors between the null-hypothesized value and the observed sample mean.

    "You can interpret the results of this test the same way as for the previous single-sample, one-tailed test. If the p-value (the area under the curve to the right of the magenta line) is smaller than our critical value (**&alpha;**) of 0.05 (the area under the curve to the right of the red line), then the difference can't be explained by chance alone; so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that students with previous math experience perform better on average than students without.\n",

    "In the two-sample test we conduced previously, the samples were independent; in other words there was no relatioship between the observations in the first sample and the observations in the second sample. Sometimes you might want to compare statistical differences between related observations before and after some change that you believe might influence the data.\n",

    "For example, suppose our students took a mid-term exam, and later took and end-of-term exam. You might hypothesise that the students will improve their grades in the end-of-term exam, after they've undertaken additional study. We could test for a general improvement on average across all students with a two-sample independent test, but a more appropriate test would be to compare the two test scores for each individual student.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we need to create two samples; one for scores in the mid-term, exam, the other for scores in the end-of-term exam. Then we need to compare the samples in such a way that each pair of observations for the same student are compared to one another. \n",
